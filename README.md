Started with a lesson that taught a foundation for multiplayer 3D battle royal game using Unity and Photon. Along with lobby browser, spectator mode, and using UI to creat network-aware menus.

I added the 'Hide and Seek' theme were players are randomly givin a skin to blend in with the open environment as well as added the option to switch view by pressing the 'F' key.
