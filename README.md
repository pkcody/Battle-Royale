Battle Royal was started with a lesson that taught a foundation for multiplayer 3D battle royal game using Unity and Photon. Along with lobby browser, spectator mode, and using UI to create network-aware menus.

I added the 'Hide and Seek' theme in which players are randomly given a skin to blend in with the open environment; in addition, I added the option to switch views by pressing the 'F' key.
